## Environment Variables by @gamell

Given that some might want always to create the cards on the same list, or with the same label, or same due date, or same position _by default_, I added the ability to set those defaults via the environment variables `trello.list_name`, `trello.label`, `trello.due` and `trello.position`.

One can conveniently add or edit those environment variables without programming knowledge through the Alfred Workflow editor, clicking on the `[x]` button on the top right (see screenshot below). 

*Note:* If you don't set the variable, the workflow will behave as it did before.
